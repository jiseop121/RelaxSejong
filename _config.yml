  The "Relax-Sejong" project aims to enhance the convenience for Sejong University students by providing real-time congestion data on various campus locations through a web platform.
  The locations are categorized as 'Congested,' 'Moderate,' and 'Spacious' based on meticulously calculated criteria. This eliminates the need for students to wander around in search of a quiet place for relaxation during study sessions.
